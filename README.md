## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The bot is launched from the Appilot dashboard, where the seller defines customer segments and campaign types (thank-you, discount, or feedback).  
2. **Core Logic** — Using UI Automator and Appium, it logs into the seller’s app, navigates to the messaging center, and auto-sends personalized messages.  
3. **Output or Action** — The bot delivers customized re-engagement content and logs results (responses, message status, time).  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Retry mechanisms, delay randomization, message templating, and multi-threaded processing for efficient mass operations.

## Tech Stack

**Language:** Kotlin, Java, Python  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized Device Farms, Cloud Emulators, Proxy Networks, Parallel Execution, Centralized Logs
